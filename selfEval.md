# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
I feel pretty good with comparison operators.  I have worked with them a little bit in the past

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
I also feel ok with logical operators, although a bit rusty

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
Altogether pretty good with if statements, but I have to remember to consider the order of any else if statements to get the desired results!

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
I spent about an hour and a half on this...longer than I had hoped, haha!

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I still need to get more comfortable / confident with making videos on the spot and trusting that I can do the challenges!

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
None right now, but I'm sure they will come up as I start another challenge.
I'll start with asking my small group and then expand to the mod0 intensive slack channel or study hall
